Here in this notebook i want to make a basic machine learning and data science tutorial through iris dataset,
for complete beginners. i tried to cover a lots of algorithms that new kagglers and brand new machine learning lovers,
have a good sense about most important concepts in these fields
In this tutorial we will cover many algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM 
and also ensemble methods like Random Forest and adaboost also we cover some sort of optimizing method like
GridSearch and elbow method, feature scaling,  visualizations and more fun stuff in ML
